# aioRestaurants
Applied Research Project for Douglas College

All in one Restaurants is about managing your store’s inventory and sales in one single connected system. The main idea for this project is for owners of businesses, mainly restaurants, deli shops and similar, to have access to all the information regarding inventory and sales in one software. This way, the owner or manager can see what is going on behind the curtains and have a look at inventory reports, what goes in and out of their business. With easy access to that information, they can make better decisions on what products to purchase for their store’s inventory and when and can also have a more precise knowledge of what is going on, like damage control, missing or disposed products and more.  

What motivates us to develop this software is to get our hands into something that takes us from prototype projects that will never be developed into something that is real and has market potential. We will have to learn about new technologies with android development so that we can integrate it with a web-based dashboard, which will monitor and deliver the store’s performance and metrics. The cashiers will have access to an android app and the management will have access to the web interface.  

We will try to make it as complete as possible, but each business can require something unique or different, making it always possible to develop new features in the future. 

We are currently working on the backend and layout for this project.
